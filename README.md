# Speech2Text
This is a simple program written for speech to text conversion
Pyaudio error is solved by deactivating the virtual enviroment and manually installing PyAudio package in Scripts folder of Python
Still an error persisits that you cant run the program using Alt+Shift+F10 it only can be executed using built-in terminal
The command to do so is py speech.py
